    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
        This website is mostly hand-written in HTML (because Markdown lacks some
        typographic features such as the non-breaking space, citation tags, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        I do my best to keep this website fast, lightweight, accessible, and privacy-friendly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lightweight: no external font, small CSS (no framework).</li>
        <li>No tracker in use, and no external script.</li>
        <li>Distributed over a CDN supporting efficient protocols.</li>
        <li>High color contrast both in light and dark mode.</li>
        <li>Use of semantic tags and attributes. (Well, when I am aware of them, to be honest.)</li>
    </ul>

        This static website is generated with a Python script that produces a <code>build.ninja</code> file which is then
        processed by the <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a> build system to generate the final HTML files.<br />
        I'm not saying it was a good idea to build a static site generator like this, but it's pretty fun! ðŸ¤·
