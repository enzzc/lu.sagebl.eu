    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
        This website is mostly hand-written in HTML (because Markdown lacks some
        typographic features such as the non-breaking space and citations tags).
    </p>
    <p>
        I do my best to make this website fast, lightweight, accessible, and privacy-friendly.
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight: no external font, small CSS (no framework)</li>
            <li>No tracker in use, and no external script.</li>
            <li>Distributed over a CDN supporting efficient protocols.</li>
            <li>High color contrast both in light and dark mode
                (ranked <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast"><code>AAA</code></a>
                by Firefox's Web Developer Tools.)
            </li>
        </ul>

        This website is generated using a Python script that produces a <code>build.ninja</code> file which is then
        processed by the <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a> build system.<br />
        I'm not saying it was the smartest way to build a static site generator, but it was pretty fun! ðŸ¤·
