  <h1>ZLS: A Reliable Live Streaming Protocol</h1>

  <p class="warning">
    ZLS is still experimental and subject to change!
  </p>

  <h2>ZLS Overview</h2>
  <p>
    ZLS is an HTTP-based live streaming protocol that does its best to work well in difficult environments, typically outdoors and using
    a cellular network, <i>e.g.:</i> unreliable 4G/LTE or 5G. ZLS allows pushing multiples segments of different kinds: video, audio, and even
    user-defined data. The latter is pretty convenient to pass arbitrary data relative to the live stream, such as the name of the current street.
  </p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Priority of stream</b> when the connection is degraded. A stream may be temporarily
    dropped to avoid congestion and allow other more important stream to pass. For example,
    audio segments may pass while video segments are dropped for a few seconds until the
    connection is strong enough again, so the audience can at least hear.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>HTTP-based</b>: because it makes implementing servers and clients easy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Segments-based</b>: because it makes interoparibility with the end delivery phrase easier,
    typically using HLS or DASH. Segments can be re-used as is.
  </p>

  <h2>Why not use...</h2>
  <h3>...RTMP?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RTMP works well in a reliable network setup, typically between a broadband connection and a Twitch POP.</li>
        <li>It's a difficult protocol to implement and to work with.</li>
        <li>Not really open.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>...SRT?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The normal version of SRT is UDP-based. It may be beneficial because of the low latency and
            to have control on the head-of-line blocking problem.
            However, we may suspect mobile carriers to treat UDP flows weirdly and unreliably.
        </li>
        <li>
            SRT supports a "too late" packet dropping mechanism, which is useful. But it cannot drop only certain
            kind of packets selectively natively. In ZLS, each stream has a priority level which defines how
            "too late" segments are dropped.
