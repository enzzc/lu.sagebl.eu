  <h1>ZLS: A Reliable Live Streaming Protocol</h1>

  <p class="warning">
    ZLS is still experimental and subject to change!
  </p>

  <p>
    ZLS is an HTTP-based live streaming protocol that does its best to work well in difficult environments, typically outdoors using
    a cellular network, <i>e.g.:</i> unreliable 4G/LTE or 5G. ZLS allows pushing multiples segments of different kind: video, audio, and even
    user-defined data. The latter is pretty convenient to pass arbitrary data relative to the live stream, such as the name of the current street.
  </p>
  <p>
    Goals:
    <ul>
        <li>Priority of stream when the connection is degraded. A stream may be temporarily
            dropped to avoid congestion and allow other more important stream to pass. For example,
            audio segments may pass while video segments are dropped for a few seconds until the
            connection is strong enough again, so the audience can at least hear.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTTP-based: because it makes implementing servers and clients easy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Segments-based: because it makes interoparibility with the end delivery phrase easier,
            typically using HLS or DASH. Segments can be re-used as is.
        </li>

    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    But, why not use...
    <ul>
        <li>
            RTMP?
            <ul>
                <li>RTMP works well in a reliable network setup, typically between a broadband connection and a Twitch POP.</li>
                <li>It's a difficult protocol to implement and to work with.</li>
                <li>Not really open.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            SRT?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The normal version of SRT is UDP-based. It may be beneficial because of the low latency and
                    to have control on the head-of-line blocking problem.
                    However, we may suspect mobile carriers to treat UDP flows weirdly and unreliably.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SRT supports a "too late" packet dropping mechanism, which is useful. But it cannot drop only certain
                    kind of packets selectively natively. In ZLS, each stream has a priority level which defines how
                    "too late" segments are dropped.
                </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
    </ul>
